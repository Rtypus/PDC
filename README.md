# Plant Disease Classification 
•	Performed image augmentation and used a deep ensemble learning strategy that combines a Convolutional Neural Network model with a Vision Transformer model for disease detection and classification. <br />
• Ideas from Olive Disease Classification Based on Vision Transformer and CNN Models: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/3998193/ <br />
• Some parts of the code come from the Python package available at https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/. <br />
